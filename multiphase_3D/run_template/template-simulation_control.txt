#  3 - a fluid1 (nonwetting phase) drop attached to y=1: contact angle measurement
#  4 - a fluid2 (wetting phase) drop attached to y=1: contact angle measurement
#  5 - a fluid1 drop located in the center of the domain: surface tension measurement
#  6 - fluid1 and fluid2 raondomely distributed in the pore space with desired fluid1
#      saturation: steady state relative perm measurement
#  0 or else - error!
